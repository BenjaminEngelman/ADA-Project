    "# Nice to Meat You : An Analysis on Meat Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Meat consumption is a highly controversial topic in nowadays society in terms of [environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown), [health](https://gamechangersmovie.com/), and [ethical](http://traslosmuros.com/en/slaughterhouse-documentary/) reasons. This situation introduces different ways of consuming meat and divides people according to their behaviors such as vegan, vegetarian, occasional meat consumer, and people consuming large amounts of meats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are particularly interested in the factors related to consuming meat and how the behavior of households varies according to their meat consumption. We are going to focus on demographic information such as economic status, family composition, age, and their relation with consuming meat. Moreover, we are going to study external effects that are related to meat consumption such as seasonal changes, campaigns, and discounts. Finally, we are going to categorize households according to their meat consumption and perform a behavior analysis per category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we are going to use the Dunnhumby dataset. This dataset contains shopping information collected over two years from a group of 2,500 households as well as their information for each household. Moreover, we are planning to expand our analysis with an additional dataset about nutritional information.\n",
