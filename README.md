# Dataset
[Dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/careers/engineering/sourcefiles): This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. Moreover, this dataset provides demographic information for households as well as information about campaigns and discounts of stores.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
## Until 7th of November
* Get familiar with the tables and their relations

# Questions for TAs
* How can we move from household level to individual level? Can we get in contact with Dunnhumby for more information on it?
* Do you know in which country/countries this data was collected since we could not find information about it in dunnhumby's data description?
* Do you also know if they use a standardized product description in their product table (COMMODITY_DESC COLUMN) so that we can find more information about these products in different datasets?
